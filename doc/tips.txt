Running confiugurations for small arrays on larger arrays.

Running a configuration for a 4x4 array on a 8x8 array, does generally
_not_ work, since the zippy array uses cyclical continuation of
routing. Therefore cells c_0_0 and c_0_3 are direct neighbors on a 4x4
array, but are no direct neighbors on a 8x8 array. If local
interconnect is used, the circuit will not be portable.
