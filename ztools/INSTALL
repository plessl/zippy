INSTALLING ZTOOLS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install the following packages from CPAN:

 Heap
 Graph
 Test::Unit
 XML::Writer


This can by easily achieved by using the CPAN.pm module

perl -MCPAN -eshell

If non root user, configure CPAN.pm to install packages into home directory. 
Add ~/Perl/lib to your PERL5LIB environment variable

export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:~/Perl/lib 

In the configuration phase for CPAN.pm chose a custom PREFIX and LIB path,
when CPAN.pm asks about additional arguments to be passed to MakeMaker

  PREFIX=~/Perl LIB=~/Perl/lib

After that, CPAN.pm can be used to install the non-standard Perl modules, that
are used by ztools

  install Heap
  install Graph
  install Test::Unit
  install XML::Writer

RUNNING ZTOOLS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To acheive reproducable runs set the following environment variable:
  export PERL_HASH_SEED=0
This prevents Perl from returning the keys in a hash in randomized order.
