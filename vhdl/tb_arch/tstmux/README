This testbench provides a couple of features for automated regression
testing. The testbench does not only provide stimuli to be applied to
the DUT, but also the expected reponses for these stimuli.

The testbench automatically verifies, that the response of the DUT
matches the expected responses.

Standalone simulation with the testbench can be done using the:

  ./runTestbench.sh script


which calls the runTestbench.do TCL script within ModelSim. The
runTestbench.do script installs a handler to detect the end of a
(successful) simulation.


  set NumericStdNoWarnings 1
  run 0ns
  set NumericStdNoWarnings 0
  when { /tbStatus == done } {
     echo "Testbench successfully terminated at time $now"
     quit -f
  }
  run -all
  quit
